             An independent field is one whose value can be changed externally at
             any time. Create one Independent sentry for each independent field in
             your object.

            If any dependent field has used this independent field while updating,

            however, it no longer depends upon this field.
            <para/>
            This property is useful for caching. When all dependents are up-to-date,
            check this property for cached fields. If it is false, then nothing
            depends upon the field, and it can be unloaded. Be careful not to
            unload the cache while dependents are still out-of-date, since
            those dependents may in fact need the field when they update.

            <summary>Gets or sets a flag that allows extra debug features.</summary>
            <remarks>
            This flag currently just controls automatic name detection for untitled
            NamedIndependents, and other precedents that were created without a name 
            by calling <see cref="M:UpdateControls.Independent.New"/>() or <see cref="M:UpdateControls.Dependent.New(System.Action)"/>(),
            including dependents created implicitly by <see cref="!:GuiUpdateHelper"/>.
            <para/>
            DebugMode should be enabled before creating any UpdateControls sentries,
            otherwise some of them may never get a name. For example, if 
            Indepedent.New() is called (without arguments) when DebugMode is false, 
            a "regular" <see cref="T:UpdateControls.Independent"/> is created that is incapable of 
            having a name.
            <para/>
            DebugMode may slow down your program. In particular, if you use named 
            independents (or <see cref="!:Independent&lt;T&gt;"/>) but do not explicitly 
            specify a name, DebugMode will cause them to compute their names based 
            on a stack trace the first time OnGet() is called; this process is
            expensive if it is repeated for a large number of Independents.

            The update parameter is allowed to be null, so that derived classes

            defined in a derived class can't be passed to the constructor of the 
            base class. Instead, update must be null and the _update member must 
            be set afterward.

            If the controlled field is out-of-date, this function calls the

            is currently updating, that dependent depends upon this one; when this

            While it is not absolutely necessary to call this method, doing

            <summary>
            A collection that maps new objects to old, equivalent versions of the
            same objects. It is typically used with LINQ during a Dependent update.
            </summary>
            <typeparam name="T">Type of object to recycle. When using the MVVM design
            pattern, T is typically a type of view-model that wraps around a model
            type.</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            This class helps implement the MVVM pattern with UpdateControls. In this
            pattern, you typically write a "Model" class which contains all the state
            information for your models, and a "ViewModel" class which is a thin 
            wrapper around the Model. The ViewModel should be stateless, except for
            temporary information that is only meaningful in the GUI, such as an 
            "IsSelected" flag that represents whether the ViewModel is selected in
            a ListBox.
            <para/>
            In the UpdateControls paradigm, you will typically create (at most) one
            ViewModel object for each Model, and some kind of dependent collection is 
            used to keep the set of ViewModels synchronized with the set of Models. 
            RecycleBin plays an important role in this paradigm. If you use a class 
            such as <see cref="T:UpdateControls.Collections.DependentList`1"/>, it will use a RecycleBin for you,
            but if you use <see cref="T:UpdateControls.Dependent"/> directly then you may need to 
            create a RecycleBin yourself.
            <para/>
            RecycleBin has two purposes: (1) it disposes old objects that are no 
            longer in use, if T implements IDisposable; and (2) it preserves any state 
            information in the ViewModel wrappers.
            <para/>
            Typical usage is as follows: you first construct a RecycleBin within a 
            <see cref="T:UpdateControls.Dependent"/>'s update function (assuming that the Dependent 
            controls a collection.) You fill the recycle bin with the old contents 
            of your collection of ViewModels, then construct a new collection of 
            ViewModels (from scratch, e.g. using a LINQ query over your models), and 
            pass each new ViewModel through the <see cref="M:UpdateControls.RecycleBin`1.Extract(`0)"/> method. If 
            the new ViewModel represents a Model that was in the old collection, 
            Extract returns the old ViewModel; otherwise it returns the new ViewModel.
            This ensures that the ViewModel state is preserved. For example, if your 
            ViewModel has an IsSelected flag, then failing to use a RecycleBin would 
            cause any selected objects to become deselected whenever the Dependent 
            is updated (assuming IsSelected is false by default).
            <para/>
            The recycle bin extracts objects based on a prototype. If
            the recycle bin contains an object matching the prototype
            according to <see cref="M:System.Object.GetHashCode"/> and
            <see cref="M:System.Object.Equals(System.Object)"/>, then that matching object
            is extracted. If not, the prototype itself is used. It is
            imperitive that you properly implement GetHashCode and
            Equals in your recycled classes.
            <para/>
            If T is a ViewModel class, then it generally suffices for T.GetHashCode 
            to call GetHashCode on the wrapped Model, and for T.Equals to compare
            the two wrapped objects for equality.
            <para/>
            In general, your implementation of GetHashCode and Equals must only 
            consider fields that do not change. If a field can be changed, or is
            itself dependent, then it must not be used either as part of the
            hash code, or to determine equality. The best practice is to
            implement GetHashCode and Equals in terms of fields that are
            initialized by the constructor, and are thereafter immutable.

            The advantage of RecycleBin is not found in any time or memory savings.
            In fact, using RecycleBin in most cases adds a small amount of overhead.
            However, the advantage comes from preserving the dynamic and
            dependent state of the recycled objects. If your depenent collection
            contains only immutable objects (such as strings), there is no
            advantage to using a RecycleBin.

            Call this method at the end of the update function. Any objects
            that have not been recycled will be disposed, thus removing any
            dependencies they may have. This allows cached objects to be
            unloaded and garbage collected.

            To use DependentDictionary, you must pass a method to the constructor whose 
            job is to choose the contents of the dictionary (either as a list of key-
            value pairs, or as an object that implements <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2"/>).

            <param name="updateCollection">A method that is called to choose the 
            contents of the dictionary.</param>
            <remarks>
            The update method will be called automatically when someone accesses the 
            dictionary, and either (1) it is being accessed for the first time, or
            (2) one of the precedents (Dependent and Independent sentries) that were 
            accessed by updateCollection() has changed since the last time it was
            called.
            <para/>
            DependentDictionary assumes that the "keys" are stateless objects that
            do not require recycling, but that values do require recycling. If the
            values are stateless, you will get better performance if you disable 
            recycling by adding a "false" parameter to the constructor, especially 
            if 'updateCollection' returns a dictionary directly. However, if the 
            values are viewmodels that contain state (such as an "is selected" 
            flag), and 'updateCollection' itself doesn't preserve this state, then 
            you should use recycling (which is the default) so that the extra state 
            information is not lost during updates.
